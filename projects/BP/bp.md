Stylometry is a method used to identify authors based on their unique style used in literature or fine arts. It is often used to determine similarities within authors’ individual styles, or to attribute authorship to anonymous works of art.

The stylometry application to the source code can be widely used. It may help to identify a malicious software author, to attribute a collective of authors to copyright and copyleft as well as to determine plagiarism in programming. 

The goal of this bachelor thesis is to implement and verify a method to place a source code author to the collective of authors who use similar linguistic style. Firstly, a source code will be analysed. Secondly, style features will be determined using parsimony methods and normalised according to set parameters. Final attribution of the author to the collective of programmers will be done using artificial intelligence and machine learning.

__Key words:__ stylometry, authorship, source code, abstract syntax trees, machine learning
