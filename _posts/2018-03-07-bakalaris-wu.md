Update? Nothing works again.

The only accomplishment I managed this week is not being complete failure. I repaired my feature extracting code, but I still have so more features to extract :fearful: \\
But look! I made a graph! It's always nice to have some visualization.\\

This graph represents two of my authors and their features. Beside 6 codes (out of 26), hierarchical agglomerative clustering showed similarities between features of same author 
and distinguished the other.

With love,\\
