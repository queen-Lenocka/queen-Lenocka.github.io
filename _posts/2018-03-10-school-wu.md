It's horrible, how it's only 4th week of school and I'm already tired. 

But! I feel happy. I've already completed my assignement for Communication in cultural history, only presentation to be made. 
My page for Web publications is looking fine one day before deadline. Most problems for Analysis and complexity of algorithms are solved. 
We are like three weeks before the rest of the ring at Principles of information systems, thanks to @mackovakris and @jozef81.

But is it really worth those dreamless nights? :zzz: \\
